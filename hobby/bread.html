                <p>Sourdough is a catch all phrase for really bitter bread.
                    Kind of, more precisley it is a type of bread that is conventionally
                     naturally risen. Meaning there is no commercial yeasts involved in the 
                     levining process. I'll get into what exactly natural yeasts are later, 
                     but for now just know the commonly associated sour taste is due to them.

                <h3>More on yeast</h3>
                <p>Now my artistic abilities really shine through in this diagram.
                    So allow me to further explain the process that yeast do.
                    Firstly the baker will mix flour and water, not equal parts but very close to.
                    Then they will let the mixture sit open to the air. Natural yeasts floating about
                     near the start will be attracted to the sugars inside the mixture. This sugars are 
                     actually existant in the flour already. Once the yeast take up home in the mixture 
                     they will begin to consume, fart, deficate, and breed. They release CO2 and Ethyl Alcohol 
                     during this process and the latter is what produces the iconic sour flavor.
                     An interesting side effect of this process is that since the specific yeast in each area 
                     are unique, sourdough breads will have different flavors depending on where the bakery is.
                     This is how San Franciso sourdough is set apart from the rest.
