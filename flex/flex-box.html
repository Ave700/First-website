                </h2>
                <p>In the world of thermodynamics, which in many ways is our own world, 
                    order is a way to express a combined collection of ordered elements.
                    For instance a human is one of the most ordered objects on earth, with 
                    extreme levels of complexity.

                <h4>
                    This we call Entropy
                </h4>
                <p>As order travels the inevitable path towards disorder we find entropy.
                    A sometimes vilified concept that emphasizes our own mortality as 
                    creatures ruled by this flow of energy. Though I propose a different view.
                    One where we take this inevitable collapse of order, and direct it in positive ways.
                    From the child making a snowman, to the engine that powers your car. Everything
                    that humans do direct and influence the flow of entropy. We are the creatures that 
                    direct the universe. Not control, but guide.

                </h3>
                <p>On the contrary to order, is disorder. A simple way to understand this 
                    is with air molecules, one of the more disordered substances in existance. 
                    It disperses till there is relatively no motion or energy in the system. In 
                    some ways disorder is a form of balance, no high or low points of energy.
